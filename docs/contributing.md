# Contributing

All suggestions welcome :)!

If you'd like to contribute, see the list of [issues](https://github.com/jap-company/fields/issues) and pick one!
Or report your own. If you have an idea you'd like to discuss, that's always a good option.

If you are having doubts on the _why_ or _how_ something works, don't hesitate to ask a question in
[telegram](https://t.me/jap_fields) or via github. This probably means that the documentation, scaladocs or
code is unclear and can be improved for the benefit of all.
